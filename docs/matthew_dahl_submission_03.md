I added a few different parts to our project this time around. Not only did I work on some technical aspects but I also worked on some of the team documentation.

For the main part of my work, I was working on getting the profile page to display the correct info depending on who was logged in. With the same url for each profile I had to get the request.user info for each user to display their info on the profile.html template. Once Zander got all of the authentication work done it was easy to test by logging in and out of different users to display their info.

I also had to do some work to get each users reviews to show up on their profile page and I was able to accomplish this by creating faker data that mapped a random number of reviews to each user, so that each user had a set number of reviews they had written and with Spencers work, we can now add reviews from a users profile and have it show up in the database and website accordingly.

Lastly, I made a form for a user to be able to edit there username or email.
