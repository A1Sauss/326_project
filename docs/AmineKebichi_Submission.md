Project 2 Individual write up

I helped work on several parts of the submission, but most of my work was focused in the home page and finalizing its template and the base-generic as well. In my work with the home page I redesigned the structure entirely with a new informational panel, as well as a new search method which will be further implemented in the future. As of right now, I've designed a 3-step search method that will take into account the user's 1.) University, 2.) Major, and 3.) Course # (if they are looking for a specific course). This will be linked to a form that will filter out classes based on the input criteria and return the appropriate classes.

In the meanwhile I found some interesting ways to make the home page more simple and direct the user in the right direction with color corrected buttons and text that emphasize the important parts of the page, such as the search bars.

I also worked on the template, making sure all the css and bootstrap commands were working in unison and helped debug some issues that came with this.
