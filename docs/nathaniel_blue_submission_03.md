Nathaniel Blue - Submission 3

In this project, I worked on creating the star rating selection for the review form on the review page.  For the star rating, I made it interactive by adding javascript.  Whenever the user clicks on a start button, it will update the color of the stars to show their rating and then udpate a hidden input form with the rating value they selected.

I also helped with fixing a bug in the model that crashed the init.py.  Fixed some bugs in other pages relating to design and other errors. I helped on the user authentication to understand how it was implemented. In the model, I made it so that the faker reviews would give a random review rather than all the reviews being the same.

In the class page, I updated the review content based on the newest updates to our model.  Added the star rating for each user review and added the username for user profile. I then added a title to each review to get a general idea of what each students review was.
