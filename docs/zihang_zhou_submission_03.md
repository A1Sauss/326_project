For the log in form, I created the original one at the start of the semester. I attempted to created new forms but was behind 
Zander so instead I started working on the search function of our application.

For the search function, I modified index.html so that when clicking the search button at homepage, it will direct user to a 
search result form. I created a search_result.html where searched courses information is displayed. Then I added search url in
url.py and created the search function in view.py, this function is the tool to search keyword in our database.

Lastly, I communicated with teammates and kept them updated with my progress on time so we collaborated smoothly.
