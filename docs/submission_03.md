##### Overview
There have been a few key changes over the past few weeks with our most recent work. First we have authentication working with the ability for a user to log in and log out at will and while they are logged in they can view their unique profile page with information specifically tailored to them. Also, we have implemented the use of forms in our application. When a user wants to leave a review for a specific class they can fill out the form and add that data to our database to eventually be displayed back on the class page. Also, we are developing search function for our homepage, where a user can search a class and our application would return search results.

##### Design Overview:
To login and logout, we added buttons in the nav bar in the base_generic template. The login button only shows if you are not logged in and the logout button only shows if you are logged in. If you press login it will bring you to a custom login page where you can login and will then redirect you to your previous page.

##### Problems/Successes:

In terms of team problems/successes I think this was our best stretch yet. We all communicated on a regular basis and were on top of what each person was doing so to not duplicate any work. We also were able to efficiently run ideas off of one another for implementation ideas. The hardest part was not being able to have a physical meetup outside of class but we definitely made up for it with our digital presence. This was a quick stretch between the last submission and this one but we were able to get everything done and were are proud of our work thus far. In terms of implementation it was mostly successes. We were able to quickly get authentication up and running along with the profile page. The forms gave us a bit more of a hassle and when it came to the keyword tags part of writing a class review we decided to push off until next submission. Although we were still able to meet and exceed the requirements for the forms. Also, implementing the search function for classes is harder than we initially thought. The problem is when we try to connect our search results to our feed form, it’s not clear whether adding a function in python file or adding an additional search result form is needed yet. 


##### Team Choice:

Our team came up with the idea that creating a web application where a user can search classes is beneficial for students. For our project, we’d like to focus on search function, where a user can simply search a class or search combo class + university to get better results. We will create a search result form that filters our database and present classes that match those keywords. Additionally, if we can get the tags database configured properly, users will be able to search for “easy” or “exam-heavy” and filter by other key terms to find the perfect match for a class!
