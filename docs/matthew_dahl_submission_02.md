Matthew Dahl - Project 2 Individual write up

There were several parts of this submission that I was apart of. The first of which was setting up the models.py and the admin.py pages. I did the initial work to set up our 5 models (now 6) and assign each model its different fields as well as the type of variable each field should be. I added all of the models to the admin.py file to be able to work with the database hands on and see the result of our models. After doing the initial set up, I then worked along with Zihang to really fine tune the models and get them exactly the way that we needed them.

The next aspect I worked on was getting my assigned page (the user profile page) to look professional. I spent a lot of time working with html and css as well as drawing up some wireframes. I played around with some cool css trick to be able to be more interactive with the page and give the user a feeling of satisfaction while using the page. 

Finally, I worked in the views.py to set up the dynamic loading of data for my assigned page. I had to do a bit of work in the init.py file setting up some more faker data and then linking all of the data to my html page by making it a template and telling the data where to be injected.
