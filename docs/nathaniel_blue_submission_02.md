Nathaniel Blue - Submission 2

In this project, I contributed by setting up the static folder, configuring the base template, url mapping, aiding in setting up the templating engine, built the class page, and added dynamic data from the model onto the class page.  Lastly, I fixed random bugs that appeared with the templating.

For the static folder, I made sure that each page could access their respective css files by loading the static files into the templating engine. In the url.py folder, I added all the urls for each page, added Redirects for the urls /review/ and /class/ since there was no dynamic number passed into the url.  It will then redirect to the feed so the user can select a class.

I was assigned the class page, for this page, I used the data provided to me by the modal to add dynamic data to the page.  The dynamic data included the reviews and the specific class name, teacher, and information about the class.  I then linked the class page with the review page so that the user can write a review for this specific class.  Furthermore, I added a little bit of css and html to accommodate for these changes.

Lastly, I fixed the base template when there were bugs in not displaying the html and css correctly due to how the CSS frameworks work.  I also modified the html and css of a few other pages to correct minor visual and logical bugs.
