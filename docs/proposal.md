# Innovative Idea

We hope to take the stress and pain out of picking classes. Our project is to create a web interface where students can effortlessly search for classes. At the center of our platform will be search. Through the use of “class tags” in our user reviews, we intend to create an extensive search where a user can search for “easy Bio Gen-Ed” and the program will return a list of peer-ranked classes which fit the criteria. As a platform powered by user input, we hope to provide accurate and relevant information to help students navigate through their college career in a smart and easy way. For example, on the class page, our approach will focus on community interaction and voting to ensure that highest quality reviews rise to the top. On the search page we will filter by schools and make class recommendations based on the user’s profile. We coined our program “Classdoor” in reference to the popular job-search site “Glassdoor,” because our goals is to match students with the perfect class!


# Important Data

Our program will handle a variety of data types to ensure that users have a positive experience interacting with our site. To write reviews every user must create a profile and login with a .edu email to verify that they truly attend a specific school. If the user chooses, their profile can have an image attached to it, so we can create user community centered around academics. We will be storing data for class reviews (including star rating, grade received in the class, review title, review text, and the aforementioned “class tags” such as “easy,” “gen-ed,” “Bio” etc.) when a user inputs a review. We also intend to link reviews from “RateMyProfessor.com” This site will allow users to see relevant information about a teacher for a class, and will give us experience working with outside APIs. Additionally, by using RateMyProfessor, we pull from an established database and can rely less on user inputted-data (which may be a challenge to get). We will also store upvotes and downvotes for reviews (so that users can see the most helpful reviews sort). Finally, much of our data will be from our search function. We will need a way to input and store class data (including subject, course name,  and teacher) and search for this data. Eventually, we hope to be able to filter by this information, so users can have a search function tailored to their needs.

# User Interface

The major UI components on our website consist of the search bar on our front page for finding classes and a list of classes that show up on the next page after the user submits their search. In this list, we highlight the name of the class and it's current rating. There is then a button on the class listing to get them to read more information.  If the user clicks on this page, they will then be directed to a page that lists the rating of the class and the comments of other students' reviews.  The students will have a profile and other key information about them (anonymous username, major, and year in school).  Along with the review, other students can vote by upvoting or downvoting other students reviews to ensure that the most high quality reviews that reflect the nature of the class rise to the top.
